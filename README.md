# BikeRentalPredictor
This project aims to predict bike rental demand using multiple regression models, including:

- Linear Regression

- Random Forest

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

The models will be trained and evaluated using Python in Google Colab. The dataset will contain historical rental records along with relevant features like temperature, weather conditions, and time variables.
